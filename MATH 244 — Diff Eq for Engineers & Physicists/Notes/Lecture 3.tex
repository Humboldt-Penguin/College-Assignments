\section{Standard Form for Linear Equations}

Given $F( t,y,y') =0$, an equation where $y$ and $y'$ are linear, we can separate coefficients to find the standard form:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{y'+p( t) y=g( t)} .
\end{equation}
\
\subsection{Separable Case}

If $g( t) =0$, note that our linear equation also becomes \textbf{separable} ($y'+p( t) y=0$), which we can easily solve to yield the general solution:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{y_{gen} =Ce^{-\int p( t) \ dt}} .
\end{equation}
\
\subsection{Non-Separable Case}

Consider an equation of form eq (1). We choose some ``\underline{integrating factor}" $\mu ( t) \neq 0$ (shortened to $\mu $) such that \ $\mu '=p( t) \mu $. This property allows us to modify eq (1) as follows:
\begin{align*}
y'+p( t) y & =g( t)\\
y'\mu +p( t) \mu y & =g( t) \mu \\
y'\mu +\mu 'y & \\
( y\mu ) ' & \\
y\mu  & =\int \mu ( t) g( t) \ dt.
\end{align*}
This gives us the general equation:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{y_{gen} =\frac{1}{\mu ( t)}\int \mu ( t) g( t) \ dt.}
\end{equation}
Knowing $\mu '=p( t) \mu $, we can readily find:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\mu ( t) =e^{\int p( t) \ dt} .}
\end{equation}
