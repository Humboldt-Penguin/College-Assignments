\section{Slope Fields}

Given a family of functions representing the solutions to an ODE, we can visualize the differential equation itself as a slope field that describes the ``flow" (tangent vectors) in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. 


For example, consider the first order ODE $y'=t$ with the solution $y=\tfrac{1}{2} t^{2} +C$:

\section{Separable ODEs}

Recall that the explicit form of first-order (linear) ODEs is:
\begin{equation*}
y'=f( t,y) .
\end{equation*}


Similarly, \underline{separable ODEs} take the explicit form:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{y'=g( t) \ h( y)} .
\end{equation}
Note that the obvious implication of this is that not all first-order ODEs are separable.


\subsection{Nonlinear Separable ODEs (Procedure to Solve)}

Note that if $h( y_{0}) =0$, then $y_{0}$ is a solution of (1): the RHS is forced to be 0, and the LHS is 0 because the derivative of a constant ($y_{0}$) is 0. 



To find \textbf{non-constant} solutions, we take a similar approach to section 2.1 in Lecture Notes 1, and rewrite (1):
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dt} & =g( t) \ h( y)\\
\int \frac{dy}{h( y)} & =\int g( t) \ dt\\
a( y) & =b( t) . \numberthis
\end{align*}
This is called the \underline{implicit solution}, which effectively eliminates the derivative in favor of arbitrary functions in terms of $y$ and $t$. Finally, we can solve for some $y=y( t)$.

\

\textbf{Note 2.1.A:} If we're given some \underline{IVP} (initial value proposition $y( t_{0}) =y_{0}$), we can fully define our general solution (ie find a value of $C$),,,

Be sure to define an interval for the domain of $t$ to avoid indeterminate solutions (eg div by 0). The interval \textbf{must} be ``connected'' to the IVP (see 2.1.2). [WHY THE FUCK??? ASK IN RECITATION]

\begin{example}

\textit{Problem:} Solve $y'=t^{2} y^{2}$. 

\textit{Solution:}

$y'$ is \textit{separable}, with $\begin{cases}
g( t) =t^{2}\\
h( y) =y^{2}
\end{cases}$.



To find \textit{constant solutions}, let $h( y) =y^{2} =0$. Thus $y=0$.



For \textit{general solutions} ($y\neq 0$), find the implicit form:
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{dy}{y^{2}} & =\int t^{2} \ dt\\
\frac{-1}{y} & =\frac{t^{3}}{3} +C_{1}\\
\Longrightarrow y & =\frac{-3}{t^{3} +C} .
\end{align*}
Thus, $y_{gen} =\left\{0,\ \frac{-3}{t^{3} +C}\right\}$.

\end{example}
\

\begin{example}

\textit{Problem:} 
$\begin{cases}
y'=( 1-2x) y^{2}\\
y( 0) =\tfrac{-1}{6}
\end{cases}$

\textit{Solution:}

For $y\neq 0$,
\begin{align*}
\int \tfrac{dy}{y^{2}} & =\int ( 1-2x) \ dx\\
y & =\frac{-1}{x-x^{2} +C} .
\end{align*}
Our IVP implies $C=6$. Thus $y( x) =\frac{1}{( x-3)( x+2)}$.



Since $x\neq 3$ and $x\neq -2$, we may naively conclude that the domain of $y$ is $( -\infty ,-2) \cup ( -2,3) \cup ( 3,\infty )$. However, with Note 2.1.A in mind, we know the interval must be ``connected" to $x_{0} =0$, as defined by our IVP. Thus, the domain of $y$ is $( -2,3)$.
\end{example}
