\section{Energy of EM Waves: The Poynting Vector}

Recall that the ``energy density" of an electromagnetic field is the potential energy per volume:
\begin{equation}
u=\frac{U}{V} =\tfrac{1}{2} \epsilon _{0} E^{2} +\tfrac{1}{2\mu _{0}} B^{2} ,
\end{equation}
which when combined with $E=cB$ from the previous lecture, yields:
\begin{align*}
u & =\tfrac{1}{2} \epsilon _{0} E^{2} +\tfrac{1}{2\mu _{0}}\tfrac{E^{2}}{c^{2}} ,\\
 & \left[ use\ c=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon _{0} \mu _{0}}}\right]\\
 & =\tfrac{1}{2} \epsilon _{0} E^{2} +\tfrac{1}{2\mu _{0}} \epsilon _{0} \mu _{0} E^{2}\\
 & =\epsilon _{0} E^{2} .
\end{align*}
So $E$ and $B$ have the same energy density at any given moment in time ($u_{E} =u_{B}$). Neat!

\

Recall that for the plane wave, $\vec{E} \times \vec{B} =\vec{v}$. So we consider an EM plane wave that travels some distnace:

\begin{figure}[htp]

    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/3.1.png}
\end{figure}

By taking the derivative of equation (1), we find:
\begin{align*}
dU & =u\cdot dV\\
 & =\left( \epsilon _{0} E^{2}\right)( A\cdot c\ dt)\\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{A} \cdot \frac{dU}{dt} & =\epsilon _{0} cE^{2}\\
 & [ use\ E=cB]\\
 & =\epsilon _{0} cE( cB)\\
 & =\epsilon _{0} c^{2} EB\\
 & \left[ use\ c=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon _{0} \mu _{0}}}\right]\\
 & =\tfrac{1}{\mu _{0}} EB.
\end{align*}
If we define $S:=\frac{1}{A} \cdot \frac{dU}{dt}$, we can promote $S$ to a vector:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\vec{S} =\tfrac{1}{\mu _{0}} \ \vec{E} \times \vec{B} ,}
\end{equation}
which we call the \underline{Poynting Vector}, representing the energy flowing through EM waves.



\textit{Remark:} This better describes how energy in an AC circuit flows in one direction, in spite of the electron flow / E-field constantly reversing directions. This \href{https://www.veritasium.com/videos/2021/11/19/the-big-misconception-about-electricity}{Veritasium video} gives a great visualization of how the it's the fields transfer energy, not the electrons.

Now consider some EM plane wave moving in the $\hat{x}$\textit{ direction}, given by $\begin{cases}
\vec{E} =E_{0}\cos( kx-\omega t)\hat{y}\\
\vec{B} =B_{0}\cos( kx-\omega t)\hat{z}
\end{cases}$.

We ``reverse" the wave to move in $-\hat{x}$\textit{ direction} by flipping $\vec{B}$ and changing the phase such that as $t$ increases, the $\cos$ wave shifts to the left ($-x$ direction): $\begin{cases}
\vec{E} =E_{0}\cos( kx+\omega t)\hat{y}\\
\vec{B} =B_{0}\cos( kx+\omega t)( -\hat{z})
\end{cases}$.

We plug these $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ into the Poynting Vector from (2) to get
\begin{align*}
\vec{S} & =\tfrac{1}{\mu _{0}} E_{0} B_{0}\cos^{2}( kx-\omega t)\hat{x} .
\end{align*}
Note that this is positive for all $t$, which solidifies the notion of energy transfer (if it were oscillating back and forth, it would cancel out). 



The average of $\cos^{2}$ is a half, so the average of the Poynting vector becomes:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\langle S\rangle =\tfrac{1}{2\mu _{0}} E_{0} B_{0} .}
\end{equation*}
