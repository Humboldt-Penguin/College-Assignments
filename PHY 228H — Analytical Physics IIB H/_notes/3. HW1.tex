\begin{example}

What inductance must be connected to a 18 pF capacitor in an oscillator capable of generating 600 nm (i.e., visible) electromagnetic waves? Comment on your answer.

\end{example}



Relating frequency and wavelength of EM wave:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{c=f\lambda } .
\end{equation*}


Frequency of oscillation of current in LC circuit:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{f=T^{-1} =\frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}} .
\end{equation*}
Thus:
\begin{align*}
2\pi \sqrt{LC} & =\frac{\lambda }{c} .
\end{align*}
\textit{Note: }$c=3\times 10^{8} \ m/s$.



My mistake was forgetting that $T=\frac{1}{f}$.

\begin{example}

What is the intensity of a traveling plane electromagnetic wave if Bm is 4.8 ✕ 10−4 T?

\end{example}



"Intensity" = Average of the Poynting vector:
\begin{align*}
I=\langle S\rangle  & =\frac{1}{2\mu _{0}} E_{0} B_{0}
\end{align*}
\textit{Note: }$\mu _{0} =1.26\times 10^{-6} \ H/m$.

Power is given by:
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{P & =\frac{E}{\Delta t}} .
\end{align*}


Not needed for this problem, but energy of a photon is given by:
\begin{align*}
E & =hf\\
 & =h\frac{c}{\lambda } .
\end{align*}
\textit{Note: }$h=6.626\times 10^{-34} \ J\cdot s$

Imagine a source of power is radiating waves isotropically, which means equally in all directions. At a distance $r$, all of the radiated power is radiated through a sphere with area $4\uppi r^{2}$. So the intensity at $r$ from the source is:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{I=\frac{P}{A} =\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}} .
\end{equation*}

Critical angle is the angle of incidence that provides an angle of refraction of 90-degrees:
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\theta _{crit} =\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\right)} .
\end{equation*}
Note: be careful about where the ray is originating from when assigning $n_{2}$ and $n_{1}$.

$\theta _{c}$ represents the critical angle where any transmitted light is parallel to the surface ($\theta _{t} =90$). Effectively, this means that all light is reflected:
\begin{equation*}
\theta _{c} =\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{n_{outside}}{n_{inside}}\right) .
\end{equation*}
From the right angle, we easily see:
\begin{equation*}
\theta _{r} =90-\theta _{c} .
\end{equation*}
Finally, we find $\theta _{i}$ with Snell's Law:
\begin{equation*}
\theta _{i} =\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{n_{inside}\sin \theta _{r}}{n_{outside}}\right) .
\end{equation*}
